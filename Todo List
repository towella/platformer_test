Todo List:

-- Camera --
o walking horizontal offset
o respawn target starts with offset
o Smooth camera ease into stopped player
o target focus doesnt always work (related to camera bounds?)
o camera notes on hollow knight (adjust values mostly)
o different camera settings for dash
o camera boundaries issues on spawn and jump dash through transitions

-- Player --
o investigate player TODOs *******
o ensure commenting is accurate and OK ****

wall slide
o wall jump offset jerky and breaks collision detection :(
o dash into wall on wall can be used to prevent slide infinitely
o wall jump buffer??
o wall jump takes prescendence over normal jump

controls
o Inaccurate movement features (sticky walls, dash reset early?) **


-- Level --
o sRGB warning
o kill level instance properly
o clean spawn points
o respawn player facing correct direction


#### LARGE SCALE DIRECTION ####
