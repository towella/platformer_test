Todo List:

-- Camera --
o camera code messy
o walking horizontal offset
o Camera starts positioned on player (more accurate focus)
o Smooth camera ease into stopped player
o camera notes on hollow knight (adjust values mostly)
o different camera settings for dash

-- Player --
o investigate player TODOs *******
o ensure commenting is accurate and OK ****

wall slide
o wall jump offset jerky and breaks collision detection :(
o dash into wall on wall can be used to prevent slide infinitely
o wall jump buffer??
o wall jump takes prescendence over normal jump

controls
o Inaccurate movement features (sticky walls, dash reset early?) **


-- Level --
o sRGB warning
o kill level instance properly
o clean spawn points
o respawn player after hazard. Correct place??
