Todo List:

NOTES FAQ:
o sRGB warning - open png w/ photoshop > File > Save As > Untick ICC Profile: sRGB IEC61966-2.1 > overwrite file
o If a tiled template is not showing up in game, overwrite all default values even if desired == default


-- Camera --
o fix normal horizontal offset. Its broken :(
o walking horizontal offset
o target focus doesnt always work (related to camera bounds?)
o camera respawn player after image
o camera notes on hollow knight (adjust values mostly)
o different camera settings for dash
o zoom on custom point rather than only center of screen
o zoom drops frame rate fix


-- Player --
o ensure commenting is accurate ****

o double check efficiency and setup of lighting system
    - sprite group?
    - add raycasting?
o fix get_background_light_mask_tile so that rooms with no background layers don't cause crash (working surf has nowhere to
    get starting dimensions from)

wall slider
o wall jump cooldown timer

controls
o Inaccurate movement features (sticky walls, dash reset early?) **
o see Celeste game feel twitter thread
o delta time collision detection
o forces based movement


-- room --
o respawn is now janky with new setup (see previous frame before respawn after respawn??)
o reset parallax layers on respawn to original positionr


#### LARGE SCALE DIRECTION ####
IMPLEMENT DICTIONARIES for efficiency
Implement chunk system




add scrolling text function to game somewhere:
def write(text, scroll_text=True):
    speed = 0.03
    if scroll_text:
        for char in text:
            sys.stdout.write(char)
            sys.stdout.flush()

            time.sleep(speed)
    else:
        print(text, end="")

    print("")
