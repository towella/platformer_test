Todo List:

-- Camera --
o walking horizontal offset
o repawn target needs offset
o Smooth camera ease into stopped player
o target focus doesnt always work (related to camera bounds?), camera boundaries issues on spawn and jump dash through transitions
o camera notes on hollow knight (adjust values mostly)
o different camera settings for dash

-- Player --
o investigate player TODOs *******
o ensure commenting is accurate and OK ****

o double check efficiency and setup of lighting system
    - sprite group?
    - add raycasting?

wall slide
o wall jump offset jerky and breaks collision detection :(
o dash into wall on wall can be used to prevent slide infinitely
o wall jump buffer??
o wall jump takes prescendence over normal jump

controls
o Inaccurate movement features (sticky walls, dash reset early?) **
o see Celeste game feel twitter thread
o delta time movement
o forces based movement

-- Level --
o sRGB warning
o kill level instance properly

-- general --
o resolution

#### LARGE SCALE DIRECTION ####
